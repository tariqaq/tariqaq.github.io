## Notes to read before downloading the video:
##### (you can scroll the notes grey box _sideways_ to read fully if you are on mobile)
 
``` 
o- This video is converted from pptx to mp4 format, so it contains 
   all animation, transititons and photos.
   
o- The video file size is around 450 MB.

o- This video *does not* have any audio or video yet, as it took time 
   till night 11.40pm to convert and upload the video, so I will edit tmrw 
   morning (Thu/18/03) and add in the audio, videos from teachers and students.
   
o- Please keep in mind that now its a video, so i can increase or decrease time
   between each slide while editing *with ease*
